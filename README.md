# README

# MARRE DE TWITTER !
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

* Ruby version : 2.3.4
* Rails version : 5.1.4
* Gems added :
> * twitter
> * dotenv-rails
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.) : maybe someday.

## Deployment instructions
One file added that is on the .gitignore list :
> * .env with my personal .env password, so if you're downloading the app from this repo, you should use your own .env files
