# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the application up and running.

* Ruby version : 2.3.4
* Rails version : 5.1.4
* Gems added :
> * twitter_api
> * dotenv-rails
* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.) : maybe someday.

## Deployment instructions
Two files have been added that have been put on the .gitignore list :
> * .env with my personal .env password, so if you're downloading the app from this repo, you should use your own .env files
> * twitter_api.rb in the Lib section that contain the access tokens to my twitter app whose name is Twitter Bot second version (I think). To test the code, same as before, recreate the twitter_api.rb file with your own tokens
